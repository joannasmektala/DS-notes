My notes in Jupeter Notebooks mostly based on [Feature Engineering in Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning/) course by Soledad Galli and Train in Data Team. Each notebook relates to a different topic, e.g. imputation or categorical encoding methods. I perform those methods on a mini sample Data Frame to be able to see the results. I use several Python libraries such as `pandas`, `sklearn` and `feature-engine` to learn about their advantages and disadvantages.

There is also one case study using Adult Census dataset from Kaggle. The main purpose is to answear the question what are the characteristics of people earing more than 50K.
