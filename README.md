My notes in Jupeter Notebooks mostly based on [Feature Engineering in Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning/) course by Soledad Galli and Train in Data Team. Each notebook relates to a different topic, e.g. imputation or categorical encoding methods. I use several Python libraries such as `pandas`, `sklearn` and `feature-engine` to learn about their advantages and disadvantages.
